            <h3>FOSTER YOUTH: FINDING A PATHWAY TO HIGHER EDUCATION</h3>
			<p>DEAN, MICHELLE  LOUISE. “FOSTER YOUTH: FINDING A PATHWAY TO HIGHER EDUCATION.” Https://Communitydevelopment.Sf.Ucdavis.Edu/, 2017. </p>
			<p>Foster youth in the U.S. are significantly less likely than their peers to achieve a four-year college degree, with only 2%-11% graduating compared to 33% of the general population. This research focuses on factors aiding foster youth in higher education by conducting semi-structured interviews with participants from support programs at California State University, Sacramento, and the University of California, Davis. Key findings highlight the importance of resilience and supportive adult relationships in their educational progress. Recommendations include early outreach to foster youth, extending support program age limits, and specialized training for educators on the needs of foster youth. This information is valuable for my project on the educational outcomes of foster youth in California colleges. I can incorporate these recommendations as factors or choices in the "choose your own adventure" narrative element of my project, exploring different pathways and outcomes based on the decisions made.</p>

			<h3>Findings from the California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study (CalYOUTH): Conditions of Youth at Age 21</h3>
			<p>Courtney, Mark  E., et al. “California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study (Calyouth).” Https://Www.Researchgate.Net/, 2018. </p>
			<p>The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 significantly shifted federal responsibility in supporting foster youth transitioning to adulthood by extending Title IV-E eligibility from 18 to 21 years. States can now receive federal reimbursement for foster care payments for eligible youth until they turn 21. California, as an early adopter with the largest state foster care population, has implemented this extension, significantly impacting its child welfare system. The CalYOUTH study, led by Dr. Mark Courtney at the University of Chicago, evaluates this policy's impact on foster youth's transition outcomes in California through in-person interviews and surveys of youth, child welfare workers, and government data analysis. This information will be valuable for my project, as I plan to create a narrative featuring a fictional student navigating life and college during this age range.</p>

			<h3>FOSTER YOUTH AND HIGHER EDUCATION: A LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION RETENTION</h3>
			<p>Chretien, Naomi V., "FOSTER YOUTH AND HIGHER EDUCATION: A LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION RETENTION" (2017). Electronic Theses, Projects, and Dissertations. 463. https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/etd/463</p>
			<p>This study examines factors influencing college attendance and retention among foster youth at California State University, San Bernardino. Through eight qualitative interviews with participants of the Renaissance Scholars Program, the research highlighted the crucial role of high school teachers and counselors in encouraging college attendance, whereas family and social work support were less influential. Although all participants benefited from the Renaissance Scholars Program post-admission, many were initially unaware of it. The study reveals that positive pre-college relationships with educators often continued into college, providing significant psycho-social benefits. Conversely, those lacking support used negative expectations as motivation. This underscores the need for robust pre-college and retention support systems for foster youth. This information could be valuable for my project as it focuses on the impact of interpersonal relationships on foster youth's college attendance, contrasting with factors like financial aid and housing.</p>
