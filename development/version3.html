    <div class="cards">
        <div class="card" id="card1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">In California, 93% of foster youth aspire to attend college, yet only 4% graduate with a bachelor's degree compared to 50% of their non-foster peers. Those from foster care who do attend college face numerous challenges, including financial constraints, lack of family support, academic underpreparedness, mental health struggles, and the absence of emotional support from caring adults.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card2" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">Each of the 100 sprites you see represents a foster youth with dreams, challenges, and unique identities. Click on a sprite to learn more about them!</div>
        <div class="card" id="card3" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">As you scroll through the site, these sprites will gradually disappear, illustrating the steep drop-off in educational attainment among foster youth.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">The foster care system in California plays a crucial role in protecting vulnerable children from harm. Its primary goals include ensuring children's safety, protecting them from maltreatment and neglect, placing them in family-like settings, and providing families with the support needed for children to safely return home whenever possible.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card5" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">However, the reasons for entry into the foster care system are multiple, complex, and often intertwined with the social and environmental challenges associated with poverty. These experiences significantly impact the educational outcomes of foster youth, such as multiple school moves and the disruption of community ties.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card6" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">Students in foster care often face complex challenges arising from the instability of their living arrangements. Although children in foster care have the right to remain in their schools of origin, removal from the family home or changes in foster care placement can cause students to move schools or even districts. This instability can interrupt students' learning progression, causing them to miss topics or material already covered at their new school and adjust to new curricula, teachers, and social environments.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card7" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000"><strong>School Mobility:</strong> 34% of students in foster care moved schools during the 2018â€“19 school year compared to only 5% of non-foster students. Over four years, 71% of foster students moved schools at least once, with almost one quarter moving four or more times.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000"><strong>High-Poverty Schools:</strong> Nearly half of all students in foster care are enrolled in the highest-poverty schools, which tend to have greater resourcing challenges.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card9" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000"><strong>Absenteeism and Suspension:</strong> Foster youth are twice as likely to be chronically absent and more than four times as likely to be suspended as their non-foster peers.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card10" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000"><strong>Academic Achievement:</strong> On state tests, only 24% of foster youth meet proficiency standards in English language arts, and 15% in mathematics, compared to 51% and 40% of non-foster students, respectively.</div>
        <div class="card" id="card11" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-duration="1000">As you scroll through the narrative, observe the changes in the number of sprites. Each remaining sprite symbolizes resilience and the triumph over adversity.</div>
