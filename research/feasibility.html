			<h3>Project Features</h3>
            <p><strong>Statistics Display:</strong> The project highlights the statistic that only 4% of foster children graduate college. It uses a timeline covering elementary, middle, high school, college, and post-grad phases.</p>
            <p><strong>Interactive Timeline:</strong> Starting with 100 colorful icons, as the user scrolls down, icons disappear to show how many advance to the next educational stage, with a decreasing percentage shown over time.</p>

			<h3>Technologies and Tools</h3>
            <p><strong>Fullpage.js:</strong> For seamless vertical scrolling.</p>
            <p><strong>Animate on Scroll and Chart.js:</strong> To animate data and text as they come into view.</p>
            <p><strong>Typeit.js:</strong>  To make the text dynamic and engaging.</p>
            <p><strong>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop:</strong>  To create and design icons.</p>
            <p><strong>New Library for Shatter Animation:</strong>  Looking for a library that can add dynamic effects to the disappearing icons.</p>

            <h3>Skills Assessment</h3>
            <p>I feel confident in my design skills. I can create icons, choose color palettes, and select fonts effectively. However, I'm a bit unsure about using new or complex libraries for the technical and animated aspects of my project. I'm comfortable with some basic libraries but know I might need to learn new ones to add special effects like the shattering animation for the disappearing icons.</p>
