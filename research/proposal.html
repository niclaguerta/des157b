			<h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
			<h2>Augmented Reality in Walkable Cities</h2>
		</header>
			
	    <div class="content">
            <p>For my capstone project, I propose to explore augmented reality in walkable cities. My partner, Shelby, is interested in researching walkable cities, and I believe our ideas will complement each other well.</p>
            <p>We aim to challenge the prevailing model of car-centric cities. Augmented reality, which isn’t suitable for use while driving, could promote the development of walkable cities as AR technology becomes more common. We plan to create a data visualization showing how much time people spend in public third spaces, although we haven’t figured out the specifics of this yet. However, we are confident that we will come up with several ideas.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on the popularity of outdoor activities during the Pokémon Go era, I envision a similar increase in outdoor engagement through our project. It would be exciting to include an AR prototype in our project. I have some experience with Adobe Aero, which could be useful.</p>
            <p>While I am confident that augmented reality and walkable cities can enhance each other, the details are still unclear. I’m inspired by an AR experiment conducted in San Francisco's Japantown. Ideally, our project could introduce a captivating AR activity in walkable cities, providing alternatives to just eating, drinking, and shopping in these third spaces.</p>
