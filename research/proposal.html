			<h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
			<h2>Educational Outcomes of California Foster Youth</h2>
		</header>
			
	    <div class="content">
            <p>My project focuses on the educational outcomes of foster youth in California. I intend to work independently, though I will seek feedback from the faculty of the Guardian Scholars Program.</p>
			<p>I aim to develop an interactive narrative, similar to a "choose your own adventure" game, which chronicles the journey of a fictional student from high school to college graduation. This narrative will incorporate trends and data from my research as decision points or elements within the story.</p>
            <p>In my project, I will use speculative design to create an imaginative scenario that predict various futures for foster youth based on decisions made in the interactive narrative. By incorporating data visualization, I can make the project more engaging and informative. The mental model I will challenge aims to encourage users to rethink their existing perceptions of foster youth, enriching their understanding through the narrativeâ€™s diverse paths. Furthermore, the utopian/dystopian narratives showcase the best and worst-case educational outcomes, illustrating the significant impact of different choices and external factors on the lives of foster youth.</p>
            <p>While the final design is still a work in progress, I envision a continuous-scroll interface where data and statistics about foster youth intermittently appear, enhancing the narrative. This concept is inspired by the emotion wheel project on pudding.cool, where interactive elements engage users with integrated data visualization.</p>
